/*
 * set means 1
 * The position of LSB(or last bit) is 0, second last bit is 1 and so on
 * To set any bit we use bitwise OR | operator. As we already know bitwise OR | operator evaluates each bit of the result to 1 if any of the operandâ€™s corresponding bit is set (1). In-order to set kth bit of a number we need to shift 1 k times to its left and then perform bitwise OR operation with the number and result of left shift performed just before.
 * sample Eg to print: 2nd bit of 10 has been set | 3rd bit of 15 is already set.
